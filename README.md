# DataBase-Management-System-Using-Python-And-SQL
This project harnesses the combined power of Python, SQL, and Power BI to create a robust and dynamic Database Management System (DBMS) for the World University dataset. Python is employed for data analysis and manipulation, SQL for extracting and organizing data from the dataset, and Power BI for intuitive and insightful data visualization.

Key Features:

Python for Data Analysis: Leveraging the capabilities of Python, the project performs in-depth data analysis on the World University dataset. Python's rich ecosystem of libraries such as Pandas and NumPy facilitates efficient handling of diverse data types and structures.

SQL Data Extraction: The project seamlessly integrates SQL to extract and organize data from the dataset. SQL queries are utilized to filter, sort, and aggregate information, ensuring that the database remains organized and optimized for further analysis.

Power BI Visualization: Utilizing Power BI, the project provides a dynamic and interactive platform for visualizing the analyzed university data.
